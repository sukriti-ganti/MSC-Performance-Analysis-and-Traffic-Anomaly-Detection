# Performance Analysis and Abnormality Detection in Mobile Switching Networks

## Project Overview
This project simulates a Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) environment using Cisco Packet Tracer and applies Machine Learning to detect abnormal traffic conditions.

## Features
- Simulated MSC-based centralized network
- Generated normal and abnormal traffic scenarios
- Collected delay, packet loss, throughput, traffic rate
- Decision Tree Classifier for detection

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the model:
python main.py

## Results
Accuracy and confusion matrix are stored in the results folder.
